            <p>I usually only update my personal website if something changes professionally.
In this case, it's a job change. For this iteration of my personal website,
along with a simple style change inspired by this <a href="https://john-doe.neocities.org/">page</a>,
I thought it would be fun to also implement a simple blog.</p>
<p>To do this, I wrote a simple static site generator (SSG) in C99 simply called <code>genblog</code>
that essentially scans a directory of input files i.e. posts, and outputs HTML files. Currently, the
program's only external dependency is <a href="https://github.com/commonmark/cmark">cmark</a>,
which performs the work of parsing and outputting HTML from Markdown.
Although I'd like to have no dependencies, my previous attempt at writing an SSG
had me designing, implementing, and debugging my own custom markup language,
which took too much time. I actually would prefer my own markup language (since I had some interesting features that I wanted),
but for the sake of finishing this project, I decided to compromise and offload the work
to a library. Thankfully, cmark was very easy to build and use.
If I ever did want to revisit parsing my own
markup language in the future, removing cmark would be really simple. Just
one function call from cmark does all the work.</p>
<p>Posts are written as Markdown files but have an additional plaintext header for
metadata. The header for this post is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">title: About this Site in 2022
author: Raymond Wan
created_at: 2022/01/03
tags: programming, c, web
===
</code></pre>
<p>The metadata header is parsed and used for sorting/grouping posts. The
remaining bytes in the file are considered to be part of the post. These
bytes are fed into cmark to generate the HTML. As mentioned previously,
just one function call does all the work. Pass in a buffer with its length and some options and cmark
will return a formatted buffer back which can then be written to the output file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">char *formatted_content = cmark_markdown_to_html(post-&gt;content_raw_str.buf, post-&gt;content_raw_str.len, CMARK_OPT_UNSAFE);
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <a href="https://github.com/commonmark/cmark/blob/master/src/cmark.h#L571"><code>CMARK_OPT_UNSAFE</code></a>
prevents HTML from being escaped. This is intended because I want to have DOM
elements in the post that JavaScript libraries can search for and inject content.
For example, making visualizations with <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>,
which I plan on using some future posts I have in mind.</p>
<p>Next, I wrote a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor">template processor</a>.
I debated on whether or not I wanted to spend the effort on this but I think
it was a good decision. The template syntax is based on
<a href="https://mustache.github.io/">mustache</a> and to my surprise, this part wasn't too
difficult to implement. I believe I have all the features I need from
mustache and some more. In a previous attempt writing an SSG, I tried to keep
things &quot;simple&quot; by managing and generating HTML in the source code. Not only
did this clutter my source code with large blocks of HTML strings
(which became super annoying), I think it was less flexible than just having
a simple template processor.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of the template used for post:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;main id=&quot;site-main&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;content-meta&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;{{created_at}}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tags:
            {{#tags}}
                &lt;a href=&quot;/tags.html#{{tag_name}}&quot;&gt;{{ tag_name }}&lt;/a&gt;{{?next_tag_exists}},{{/next_tag_exists}}
            {{/tags}}
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
        {{ content }}
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>After all the the post pages have been generated, there needs to a way to organize and find the posts
Two pages are generated for this.
<a href="/blog.html"><code>blog.html</code></a> is a directory of all posts that were generated sorted by date.
<a href="/tags.html"><code>tags.html</code></a> is a directory of tags where each tag section contains posts that contain that tag.</p>
<p>Another feature for the blog that I wanted to have was math rendering via
$\LaTeX$. Right now, <a href="https://katex.org/">KaTeX</a> is used for this feature and
is one of the JavaScript dependencies. Once
the DOM content has loaded, $\KaTeX$ parses the document for latex and
renders it out. For now, this is the simplest solution to get things going but
I really want to be able to render out the LaTeX offline.
To do this, I would have to parse the content of the post for valid LaTeX myself and pass
those to KaTex (assuming that I'm still using it) via an external shell command.</p>
<p>I think that this high level overview is all that I'll go over for now.
There are more features and <em>lots</em> of optimizations that I have in mind for this project,
but in its current state, the program works as I intend. Perhaps I'll go over all of these
next year.</p>
